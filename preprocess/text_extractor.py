# For each of the data in pdf, ppt, text, preprocess them: 
# Remove URLS.
# Remove page numbers.
# Remove headers and footers.
# Remove senences with less than equal to 4 words.
# Save the clean data in a new folder called 'cleaned_data' maintaining the same structure as 'data'.
# For ppt, use only the text column.

# Integrate extractor and preprocessor.
