WHAT IS FEDERALISM?
USSR was one of the world’s super
powers, but after 1989 it simply
broke up into several independent
countries. One of the major
reasons for its break up was the
excessive centralisation and
concentration of power, and the
domination of Russia over other
regions 
with 
independent
languages and cultures of their
own e.g. Uzbekistan. Some other
countries like Czechoslovakia,
Yugoslavia, and Pakistan also had
to face a division of the country.
Canada came very close to a break
up between the English-speaking
and the French-speaking regions
of that country. Isn’t it a great
achievement that India, which
emerged as an independent
nation-state in 1947 after a painful
partition, has remained united over
seven decades of its independent
existence? What accounts for
this achievement? Can we attribute
it to the federal structure
of governance that we in
India adopted through our
Constitution? All the countries
mentioned above, were federations.
Yet they could not remain united.
Therefore, apart from adopting a
federal constitution, the nature of
that federal system and the
practice of federalism must also be
important factors.
Federalism in West Indies
You may have heard about
the cricket team of West
Indies. But is there a country
called West Indies?
Like India, West Indies
was also colonised by the
British. 
In 
1958, 
the
federation of West Indies
came into being. It had a
weak central government
and the economy of each unit
was independent. These
features 
and 
political
competition among the units
led to the formal dissolution
of 
the 
federation 
in
1962. Later, in 1973 by
Treaty 
of 
Chiguaramas
the independent islands
established joint authorities
in the form of a common
legislature, supreme court, a
common currency, and, to a
degree, a common market
known as the Caribbean
Community. The Caribbean
Community has even a
common executive, and
Heads of the governments of
member 
countries 
are
members of this executive.
Thus, the units could
neither live together as one
country, nor can they live
separately!

India is a land of continental proportions and immense
diversities. There are more than 20 major languages and
several hundred minor ones. It is the home of several major
religions. There are several million indigenous peoples
living in different parts of the country. In spite of all these
diversities we share a common land mass. We have also
participated in a common history, especially, when we
fought for independence. We also share many other
important features. This has led our national leaders to
visualise India as a country where there is unity in
diversity. Sometimes it is described as unity with diversity.
Federalism does not consist of a set of fixed principles,
which are applied, to different historical situations. Rather,
federalism as a principle of government has evolved
differently in different situations. American federalism –
one of the first major attempts to build a federal polity – is
different from German or Indian federalism. But there are
also a few key ideas and concepts associated with
federalism.
±
Essentially, federalism is an institutional mechanism
to accommodate two sets of polities—one at the
regional level and the other at the national level. Each
government is autonomous in its own sphere. In some
federal countries, there is even a system of dual
citizenship. India has only a single citizenship.
±
The people likewise, have two sets of identities and
loyalties—they belong to the region as well as the
nation, for example we are Gujaratis or Jharkhandis
as well as Indians. Each level of the polity has distinct
powers and responsibilities and has a separate system
of government.
±
The details of this dual system of government are
generally spelt out in a written constitution, which is
considered to be supreme and which is also the source
of the power of both sets of government.



Federalism in Nigeria
If the regions and various communities do not trust each
other, even a federal arrangement can fail to produce unity.
The example of Nigeria is instructive:
Till 1914, Northern and Southern Nigeria were two
separate British colonies. At the Ibadan Constitutional
Conference of 1950 Nigerian leaders decided to form a
federal constitution.  The three major ethnic groups of
Nigeria—Yoruba, Ibo and Hausa-Fulani—controlled the
regions of the West, the East and the North respectively.
Their attempt to spread their influence to other regions
led to fears and conflicts. These led to a military regime.
In the 1960 constitution, both federal and regional
governments jointly controlled the Nigerian police. In the
military-supervised constitution of 1979, no state was
allowed to have any civil police.
Though democracy was restored in Nigeria in 1999,
religious differences along with conflicts over who will
control revenues from the oil resources continue to present
problems before the Nigerian federation. Local ethnic
communities resist centralised control of the oil resources.
Thus, Nigeria is an example of overlap of religious, ethnic
and economic differences among the units.

FEDERALISM WITH A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
It is generally accepted that the Indian Constitution has created a
strong central government. India is a country of continental
dimensions with immense diversities and social problems. The
framers of the Constitution believed that we required a federal
constitution that would accommodate diversities. But they also
wanted to create a strong centre to stem disintegration and bring
about social and political change. It was necessary for the centre to
have such powers because India at the time of independence was
not only divided into provinces created by the British; but there were
more than 500 princely states which had to be integrated into existing
States or new States had to be created.
“Let me tell my honourable Friends
in the House that the drift… in all
constitutions has been towards the
centre... because of circumstances
that have now come into being
that the States have become,
...federal or unitary, welfare states
from being Police States and the
ultimate responsibility as for the
economic well-being of the country
has 
become 
the 
paramount
responsibility of the centre.”
T.T. Krishnamachari, CAD, Vol. XI, p. 955-956, 25 November 1949
Besides the concern for unity, the makers of the Constitution
also believed that the socio-economic problems of the country needed
to be handled by a strong central government in cooperation with
the States. Poverty, illiteracy and inequalities of wealth were some of
the problems that required planning and coordination. Thus, the
concerns for unity and development prompted the makers of the
Constitution to create a strong central government.
Let us look at the important provisions that create a strong central
government:


This gives
the central government an opportunity to delay the
State legislation and also to examine such bills and
veto them completely.
±
There may be occasions when the situation may
demand that the central government needs to legislate
on matters from the State list. This is possible if the
move is ratified by the Rajya Sabha. The Constitution
clearly states that executive powers of the centre are
superior to the executive powers of the States.
Furthermore, the central government may choose to
give instructions to the State government.
The following extract from an article of the Constitution
makes this clear.
Article 257 (1):  The executive
power of every State shall be so
exercised as not to impede or
prejudice the exercise of the
executive power of the Union, and
the executive power of the Union
shall extend to the giving of such
directions to a State as may
appear to the Government of India
to be necessary for that purpose.
±
You have already studied in the chapter on executive
that we have an integrated administrative system. The
all-India services are common to the entire territory of
India and officers chosen for these services serve in
the administration of the States. Thus, an IAS officer
who becomes the collector or an IPS officer who serves
as the Commissioner of Police, are under the control
of the central government. States can neither take
disciplinary action nor can they remove these officers
from service.
Oh! The central government
appears to me to be all-
powerful. Don’t the States
complain about it?



Articles 33 and 34 authorise the Parliament to protect persons in the
service of the union or a state in respect of any action taken by
them during martial law to maintain or restore order. This
provisions further strengthens the powers of the union government.
The Armed Forces Special Powers Act has been made on the basis
of these provisions. This Act has created tensions between the
people and the armed forces on some occasions.



CONFLICTS IN INDIA’S FEDERAL SYSTEM
In the previous section, we have seen that the Constitution has vested
very strong powers in the centre. Thus, the Constitution recognises
the separate identity of the regions and yet gives more powers to the
centre. Once the principle of identity of the State is accepted, it is
quite natural that the States would expect a greater role and powers
in the governance of the State and the country as a whole. This leads
to various demands from the States. From time to time, States have
demanded that they should be given more powers and more
autonomy. This leads to tensions and conflicts in the relations between
the centre and the States. While the legal disputes between the centre
and the States (or between States) can be resolved by the  judiciary,
demands for autonomy are of political nature and need to be resolved
through negotiations.


Centre-State Relations
The Constitution is only a framework or a skeleton, its flesh and
blood is provided by the actual processes of politics. Hence federalism
in India has to a large extent been influenced by the
changing nature of the political process. In the 1950s and
early 1960s the foundation of our federalism was laid
under Jawaharlal Nehru. It was also a period of Congress
dominance over the centre as well as the States. Except
on the issue of formation of new States, the relations
between the centre and the States remained quite normal
during this period. The States were hopeful that they would
be making progress with the help of the grants-in-aid from
the centre. Besides, there was considerable optimism
about the policies of socio-economic development designed
by the centre.
In the middle of the 1960s Congress dominance
declined somewhat and in a large number of States
opposition parties came to power. It resulted in demands
for greater powers and greater autonomy to the States. In
fact, these demands were a direct fallout of the fact that
different parties were ruling at the centre and in many
States. So, the State governments were protesting against
what they saw as unnecessary interference in their
governments by the Congress government at the centre.
The Congress too, was not very comfortable with the idea
of dealing with governments led by opposition parties.
This peculiar political context gave birth to a discussion
about the concept of autonomy under a federal system.
Finally, since the 1990s, Congress dominance has
largely ended and we have entered an era of coalition
politics especially at the centre. In the States too, different
parties, both national and regional, have come to power.
This has resulted in a greater say for the States, a respect
for diversity and the beginning of a more mature
federalism. Thus, it is in the second phase that the issue
of autonomy became very potent politically.
Demands for Autonomy
Many States and even many political parties have, from
time to time, demanded that States should have more
autonomy vis-à-vis the central government. However,
This is quite interesting. So, laws
and constitutions alone do not
decide everything. After all,
actual politics decides the nature
of our government!



In December 1953,
the States Reorganisation Commission was set up and it
recommended the creation of linguistic States, at least for
the major linguistic groups. In 1956, reorganisation of
some States took place. This saw the beginning of the
creation of linguistic States and the process is still
continuing. Gujarat and Maharashtra were created in
1960; Punjab and Haryana were separated from each other
in 1966. Later, the North Eastern region was reorganised
and new States like  Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya,
Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh were created.
Some regions and linguistic groups are still
struggling for separate Statehood like Vidarbha in
Maharashtra.
Interstate Conflicts
While the States keep fighting with the centre over
autonomy and other issues like the share in revenue
resources, there have been many instances of disputes
between two States or among more than two States. It is
true that the judiciary acts as the arbitration mechanism
on disputes of a legal nature but these disputes are in
reality not just legal. They have political implications and
therefore they can best be resolved only through
negotiations and mutual understanding.
So, federalism is all about
conflicts! First, we talked about
Centre-State conflicts and now
conflict among States. Can’t we
live together peacefully?

So, it is not easy to resolve this dispute
merely on the basis of linguistic majority. One of the long-
standing border disputes is the dispute between
Maharashtra and Karnataka over the city of Belgaum.
Manipur and Nagaland too, have a long-standing border
dispute. The carving out of Haryana from the erstwhile
State of Punjab has led to dispute between the two States
not only over border areas, but over the capital city of
Chandigarh. This city today houses the capital of both
these States. In 1985, the then Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi reached an understanding with the leadership of
Punjab. According to this understanding, Chandigarh
was to be handed over to Punjab. But this has not
happened yet.
While border disputes are more about sentiment, the
disputes over the sharing of river waters are even more
serious, because they are related to problems of drinking
water and agriculture in the concerned States. You might
have heard about the ‘Kaveri’ water dispute. This is a
major issue between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers
in both the States are dependent on Cauvery waters.
Though there is a river water tribunal to settle water
disputes, this dispute has reached the Supreme Court.
In another similar dispute Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra are battling over sharing the waters of
Narmada river. Rivers are a major resource and therefore,
disputes over river waters test the patience and cooperative
spirit of the States.



SPECIAL PROVISIONS
The most extra-ordinary feature of the federal arrangement
created in India is that many States get a differential
treatment. We have already noted in the chapter on
Legislature that the size and population of each State being
different, an asymmetrical representation is provided in
the Rajya Sabha. While ensuring minimum representation
to each of the smaller States, this arrangement also
ensures that larger States would get more representation.
In the case of division of powers, too, the Constitution
provides a division of powers that is common to all the
States.  And yet, the Constitution has some special
provisions for some States given their peculiar social and
historical circumstances. Most of the special provisions
pertain to the north eastern States (Assam, Nagaland,
Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, etc.) largely due to their
sizeable indigenous tribal population with a distinct
history and culture. However, these provisions have not
been able to stem alienation and the insurgency in parts
of the region. Special provisions also exist for hilly States
like Himachal Pradesh and some other States like Andhra
Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra Sikkim and
Telangana.
Jammu and Kashmir
The other State which had a special status was Jammu
and Kashmir (J&K) (Art. 370). Jammu and Kashmir was
one of the large princely States, which had the option of
joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent.

Chapter 7: Federalism
However, immediately after independence in October, 1947 Pakistan
sent tribal infiltrators from its side to capture Kashmir. This forced
the Maharaja Hari Singh to ask for Indian help and acceded to the
Indian Union.
Many of the Muslim majority areas in the Western and Eastern
parts joined Pakistan but J&K was an exception. Under these
circumstances, it was given much greater autonomy by the
Constitution. According to Article 370, the concurrence of the State
was required for making any laws in matters mentioned in the Union
and Concurrent lists. This was different from the position of other
states. In the case of the other States, the division of powers as listed
through three lists automatically applies. In the case of Jammu and
Kashmir, the central government had only limited powers and other
powers listed in the Union list and Concurrent list could be used
only with the consent of the State government. This gave greater
autonomy to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
Earlier, there was a constitutional provision that allowed the
President, with the concurrence of the State government, to specify
which parts of the Union list should apply to the State. The President
had issued two Constitutional orders in concurrence with the
government of J&K making large parts of the Constitution applicable
to the State. As a result, though J&K had a separate constitution
and a flag, the Parliament’s power to make laws on subjects in the
Union List was fully accepted.
The remaining difference between the other States and the State
of J&K were that no emergency due to internal disturbances could
be declared in J&K without the concurrence of the State. The Union
government could not impose a financial emergency in the State and
the Directive Principles did not apply in J&K. Amendments to the
Indian Constitution (under Art. 368) could apply in concurrence
with the government of J&K.
At present, the special status given under 370 no longer exists.
By the Jammu and Kashmir reorganisation Act 2019, the State has
been bifurcated into two Union Territories viz., (i) Jammu and
Kashmir and (ii) Ladakh. The new arrangement has come into effect
from 31 October, 2019.

Conclusion
Federalism is like a rainbow, where each colour is separate, yet
together they make a harmonious pattern. Federalism has to
continuously maintain a difficult balance between the centre
and the States. No legal or institutional formula can guarantee
the smooth functioning of a federal polity. Ultimately, the people
and the political process must develop a culture and a set of
values and virtues like mutual trust, toleration and a spirit of
cooperation. Federalism celebrates both unity as well as
diversity. National unity cannot be built by streamlining
differences. Such forced unity only generates greater social strife
and alienation and tends finally to destroy unity. A responsive
polity sensitive to diversities and to the demands for autonomy
can alone be the basis of a cooperative federation.
