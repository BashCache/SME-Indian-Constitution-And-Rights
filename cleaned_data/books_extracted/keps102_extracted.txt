Freedom Human history provides many examples of people and communities which have been dominated, or enslaved, or exploited, by more powerful groups. But it also provides us with inspiring examples of heroic struggles against such domination. What is this freedom for which people have been willing to sacrifice and die? In its essence, the struggle for freedom represents the desire of people to be in control of their own lives and destinies and to have the opportunity to express themselves freely through their choices and activities. Not just individuals but societies also value their independence and wish to protect their culture and future. However, given the diverse interests and ambitions of people any form of social
living requires some rules and regulation. These rules may require some constraints to be imposed on the freedom of individuals but it is recognised that such constraints may also free us from insecurity and provide us with the conditions in which we can develop ourselves. In political theory much of the discussion regarding freedom has therefore focused on trying to evolve principles by which we can distinguish between socially necessary constraints and other restrictions. There has also been debate about possible limitations on freedom which may result from the social and economic structures of a society. In this chapter we will look at some of these debates. In this book he talks about his personal struggle
against the apartheid regime in South Africa, about the resistance of his people to the segregationist policies of the white regiments about the humiliations, hardships and police brutalities suffe by the black people of South Africa. These ranged from being bundled into townships and being denied easy movement about the country, to being denied a free choice of whom to marry. Collectively, such measures constituted a body of constraints imposed by the apartheid regime that discriminated between citizens based on their race. For Mandela and his colleagues it was struggle against such unjust constraints, the struggle to remember
the obstacles to the freedom of all the people of South Africa just the black or the coloured but also the white people), that the Long Walk to Freedom. For this freedom, Mandela spent twenty-seven years of his life in jail, often in solitary confinement. Imagine what it meant to give up one’s youth for an ideal, to voluntarily give up the pleasure of talking with
one’s friends, of playing one’s favourite game (Mandela loved boxing), of wearing one’s favourite clothes, of listening to one’s favourite music, of enjoying the many. 2.1 THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM Aung San Suu Kyi saw her freedom as onnected to the freedom of her people. Her book essays bears the title Freedom from Fear. She says, “for me real
freedom is freedom from fear and unless you can live free from fear you cannot live a dignified human life”. These are deep thoughts that lead us to pause and consider their implications. We must not, other words suggest, be afraid of the opinions of other people, or of the attitude of authority, or of the reactions of the members of our community to the things we want to do, of the ridicule of our peers, or of speaking our mind. Yet we find that we often exhibit such fear. or Aung San Suu Kyi living a ‘dignified human life’ requires us to be able to overcome such fear.
From these two books of Nelson Mandela and Aung an Suu Kyi, we can see the power of the ideal of freedom, an ideal that was at the centre of our national struggle and the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa against British, French and Portuguese colonialism.

A concept analogous to Freedom in Indian political thought is ‘Swaraj’. The term Swaraj incorporates within it two words — Swa (Self) and Raj (Rule). It can be understood to mean both the rule of the self and rule over self. Swaraj, in the context of the freedom struggle in India referred to freedom as a constitutional and political demand, and as a value at the social-collective level. That is why Swaraj was such an important rallying cry in the freedom movement inspiring Tilak’s famous statement — “Swaraj is my birth right and I shall have it.” It is the understanding of Swaraj as Rule over the Self that was highlighted by Mahatma Gandhi in his work Hind Swaraj where he states, “It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves”. Swaraj is not just freedom but liberation in redeeming one’s self-respect, self-responsibility, and capacities for self-realisation from institutions of dehumanisation. Understanding the real ‘Self ’, and its relation to communities and society, is critical to the project of attaining Swaraj.

However, this is only one aspect of freedom. To put it in another way, freedom also has a positive dimension. To be free a society must widen the area in which individuals, groups, communities or nations,
will be able to charter their own destiny and be what they wish to be. Freedom, in this sense, allows the full development of the individual’s creativity, sensibilities and capabilities: be it in sports, science, art, music or exploration. A free society is one that enables one to pursue one’s interests with a minimum of constraints. Freedom is considered valuable because it allows us to make choices and to exercise our judgement. It permits the exercise of the individual’s powers of reason and judgement.
The Sources of Constraints Restrictions on the freedom of individuals may come from domination and external controls. Such restrictions may be imposed by force or they may be imposed by a government through laws which embody the power of the rulers over the people and which may have the backing of force. This was the form of constraint represented by colonial rulers over their subjects, or by the system of apartheid in South Africa. Some form of government may be inevitable but if the government is a democratic one, the members
of a state could retain some control over their rulers. That is why democratic government is considered to be an important means of protecting the freedom of people. But constraints on freedom can also result from social inequality of the kind implicit in the caste system, or which result from extreme economic inequality in a society. The quotation from Subhas Chandra Bose on freedom draws attention to the need for the country to work to remove such constraints. Girls and boys should be free to decide whom
they wish to marry. Parents should have no say in this matter.” “If we are to bring about a revolution of ideas we have first to hold up before us an ideal which will galvanise our whole life. That ideal is freedom. But freedom is a word which has varied connotations and, even in our country, the conception of freedom has undergone a process of evolution. By freedom I mean all round freedom, i.e., freedom for the individual as well as for society; freedom for the rich as well as for the poor; freedom for men as well as for women; freedom for all individuals and for all classes.

The Issue of Dress Code If choosing what to wear is an expression of one’s freedom then how should we look at the following situations where there are restrictions on dress? o In China during Mao’s regime all the people had to wear ‘Mao suits’ based on the argument that it was an expression of equality. o A fatwa was issued against Sania Mirza for her style of dress that was considered, by one cleric, to be against the dress code prescribed for women. o The rules of a test match in cricket require every cricketer to wear white dress. o Students are required to wear school uniforms. Let us debate some questions. o Is the restriction on what to wear justified in all cases or only in some? When does it constitute a constraint on freedom? o Who has the authority to impose these constraints? Should religious leaders be given the authority to issue decrees on dress? Can the state decide what one should wear? Should the ICC set down rules of what to wear when playing cricket? o Is the imposition excessive? Does it diminish the many ways, people have of expressing themselves? o What are the consequences of accepting the impositions? Will the society become ‘equal’ if everyone dresses the same way as in Maoist China? Or are women being denied the participation in sports if they cannot wear clothes that would help them to compete effectively? Will the game be affected if cricketers wear coloured clothes? | People should be ready to tolerate different ways of life, different This is minor harm and should only provoke social disapproval. It is not a fit case for legal punishment. Constraining actions by the force of law should only happen when the other regarding actions cause serious harm to definite individuals. Otherwise society must bear the inconvenience in the spirit of protecting freedom.
Hate campaigns cause serious harm to the freedom of others and actions that cause ‘serious harm’ are actions on which constraints can be imposed. But we must make sure that the constraints imposed are not so severe that they destroy freedom itself. For example, we must not ask for life imprisonment for those who only conduct hate campaign. Maybe some restriction on their movement, or some curtailment of their right to hold public meetings can be considered especially if they continue to carry on this campaign in spite of warnings by the state to desist from conducting such campaigns.
In the constitutional discussions in India, the term used for such justifiable constraints is ‘reasonable restrictions’. The restrictions may be there but they must be reasonable, i.e., capable of being defended by reason, not excessive, not out of proportion to the action being restricted, since then it would impinge on the general condition of freedom in society. We must not develop a habit of imposing restrictions since such a habit is detrimental to freedom.
2.5 NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE LIBERTY Earlier in the chapter we had mentioned two dimensions of freedom school— freedom as the absence of external constraints, and freedom as the expansion of opportunities to express one’s self. In political theory these have been called negative and positive liberty. ‘Negative liberty’ seeks to define and defend an area in which the individual would be inviolable, in which he or she could ‘do, be or become’ whatever he or she wished to ‘do, be or become’. This is an area in which no external authority can interfere. It is a minimum area that is sacred and in which whatever the individual does, is not to
The existence of the ‘minimum area of non- interference’ is the recognition that human nature and human dignity need an area where the person can act unobstructed by others. How big should this area be, or what should it contain, are matters of discussion, and will continue to be matters of debate since the bigger the area of non-interference the more the freedom. All we need to recognise is that the negative liberty tradition argues for an inviolable area of non-interference in which the individual can express himself or herself. If the area is too small then human dignity gets compromised. We may here ask the
obvious question: Is the choice of what clothes to wear in different situations – school, playing-field, office – a choice that belongs to the minimum area and therefore one that cannot be interfered with by external authority or is it a choice that can be interfered with by state, religious authority, ICC or CBSE. Negative liberty arguments are in response to the question: ‘Over what area am I the master?’ It is concerned with explaining the idea of ‘freedom from’. The individual to develop his or her capability must get the benefit of enabling positive conditions in material, political and social domains. That is, the person must
not be constrained by poverty or unemployment; they must have adequate material resources to pursue their wants and needs. They must also have the opportunity to participate in the decision making process so that the laws made reflect their choices, or at least take those preferences into account. Above all, to develop their mind and intellect, individuals must have access to education and other associated opportunities necessary to lead a reasonably good life. Positive liberty recognises that one can be free only in society
(not outside it) and hence tries to make that society such that it enables the development of the individual whereas negative liberty is only concerned with the inviolable area of non-interference and not with the conditions in society, outside this area, as such. Of course negative liberty would like to expand this minimum area as much as is possible keeping in mind, however, the stability of society. Generally they both go together and support each other, but it can happen that tyrants justify their rule by invoking arguments of positive liberty.
Freedom of Expression One of the issues that is considered to belong to the minimum area of ‘non-interference’ is the freedom of expression. J.S.Mill set out good reasons why freedom of expression should not be restricted. This is a good case for discussion. At various times there have been demands to ban books, plays, films, or academic articles in research journals. Let us think about this demand to ban books in the light of our discussion so far which sees freedom as ‘the making of choices’, where a distinction is made between ‘negative and positive liberty’, where we recognise the need
for ‘justifiable constraints’ but these have to be supported by proper procedures and important moral arguments. Freedom of expression is a fundamental value and for that society must be willing to bear some inconvenience to protect it from people who want to restrict it. Remember Voltaire’s statement — ‘I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to death your right to say it’. How deeply are we committed to this freedom of expression? Some years ago Deepa Mehta, film maker, wanted to make a film about widows in Varanasi. It sought to explore the plight of widows but there was a strong protest from a section of the polity who felt
that it would show India in a very bad light, who felt it was being made to cater to foreign audiences, who felt it would bring a bad name to the ancient town. They refused to allow it to be made and as a result it could not be made in Varanasi. It was subsequently made elsewhere. Similarly the book Ramayana Retold by Aubrey Menon and The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie were banned after protest from some sections of society. The film The Last Temptation of Christ and the play Me Nathuram Boltey were also banned after protests. Banning is an easy solution for the short term since it meets the immediate demand but is very harmful for the long-term prospects
of freedom in a society because once one begins to ban then one develops a habit of banning. But does this mean that we should never ban? After all we do have censorship of films. John Stuart Mill, a political thinker and an activist in the nineteenth century Britain, offered a passionate defence of freedom of expression, including freedom |ust for interest, in England nyone who is employed to work or the Royal household is onstrained by contract (a onstraint?) from writing about the nner affairs of the household. So such a person were to leave the mployment they would be unable o give an interview or write an rticle or author a book about the olitics of the Royal household. Is his an unjustifiable constraint on he freedom of expression? Constraints of different kind hus exist and we are subject to hem in different situations. hile reflecting on such ituations we need to realise that hen constraints are backed by rganised social — religious or ultural — authority or by the ight of the state, they restrict ur freedom in ways that are ifficult to fight against. However, we willingly, or for the sake of ursuing our goals or ambitions, ccept certain restrictions, our eedom is not similarly limited. n any case if we are not coerced | of thought and discussion. In his book On Liberty he offered four reasons why there should be freedom of expression even for those who espouse ideas that appear ‘false’ or misleading today. First, no idea is completely false. What appears to us as false has an element of truth. If we ban ‘false’ ideas, we would lose that element of truth that they contain. This is related to the second point. Truth does not emerge by itself. It is only through a conflict of opposing views that truth emerges. Ideas that seem wrong today may have been very valuable in the emergence of what we consider right kind of ideas. Thirdly, this conflict of ideas is valuable not just in the past but is of continuing value for all times. Truth always runs the risk of being reduced to an unthinking cliché. It is only when we expose it to opposing views that we can be sure that this idea is trustworthy. Finally, we cannot be sure that what we consider true is actually true. Very often ideas that were considered false at one point by the entire society and, therefore, suppressed turned out to be true later on. A society that completely suppresses all ideas that are not acceptable today, runs the danger of losing the benefits of what might turn out to be into accepting the conditions, very valuable knowledge. We began by saying that freedom is the absence of external constraints. We have now come to realise that freedom embodies our capacity and our ability to make choices. And when we make choices, we have also to accept responsibility for our actions and their consequences. It is for this reason that most advocates of
liberty and freedom maintain that children must be placed in the care of parents. Our capacity to make the right choices, to assess in a reasoned manner available options, and shoulder the responsibility of our actions, have to be built through education and cultivation of judgement just as much as it needs to be nurtured by limiting the authority of the state and the society.
Freedom
Human history provides many examples of people and communities which have been
dominated, or enslaved, or exploited, by more powerful groups. But it also provides us
with inspiring examples of heroic struggles against such domination. What is this freedom
for which people have been willing to sacrifice and die? In its essence, the struggle for
freedom represents the desire of people to be in control of their own lives and destinies
and to have the opportunity to express themselves freely through their choices and
activities. Not just individuals but societies also value their independence and wish to

living requires some rules and regulation. These rules may require some constraints
to be imposed on the freedom of individuals but it is recognised that such constraints
may also free us from insecurity and provide us with the conditions in which we can
develop ourselves. In political theory much of the discussion regarding freedom has
therefore focused on trying to evolve principles by which we can distinguish between
socially necessary constraints and other restrictions. There has also been debate about
possible limitations on freedom which may result from the social and economic
structures of a society. In this chapter we will look at some of these debates. In this book he talks about his personal struggle

about the humiliations, hardships and police brutalities suffe

Thus far we have defined freedom as the absence of constraint. To be free means to reduce or minimise social constraints that
limit our ability to make choices freely. However, this is only one
aspect of freedom. To put it in another way, freedom also has a
positive dimension. To be free a society must widen the area in
which individuals, groups, communities or nations,
will be able to charter their own destiny and be what

and capabilities: be it in sports, science, art, music or

pursue one’s interests with a minimum of constraints. Freedom is considered valuable because it allows us
to make choices and to exercise our judgement. It
permits the exercise of the individual’s powers of
reason and judgement.
The Sources of Constraints
Restrictions on the freedom of individuals may come from
domination and external controls. Such restrictions may be imposed
by force or they may be imposed by a government through laws
which embody the power of the rulers over the people and which
may have the backing of force. This was the form of constraint
represented by colonial rulers over their subjects, or by the system
of apartheid in South Africa. Some form of government may be
inevitable but if the government is a democratic one, the members
of a state could retain some control over their rulers. That is why
democratic government is considered to be an important means of
protecting the freedom of people. But constraints on freedom can also result from social inequality
of the kind implicit in the caste system, or which result from extreme
economic inequality in a society. The quotation from Subhas
Chandra Bose on freedom draws attention to the need for the
country to work to remove such constraints. Girls and boys should
be free to decide whom
they wish to marry. Parents should have no
say in this matter.”

“If we are to bring about a revolution of ideas we have first to hold up before us an ideal which will galvanise our whole life. That ideal is freedom. But freedom is a word which has varied connotations and, even in our country, the conception of freedom has undergone a process of evolution. By freedom I mean all round freedom, i.e., freedom for the individual as well as for society; freedom for the rich as well as for the poor; freedom for men as well as for women; freedom for all individuals and for all classes. This freedom implies not only emancipation from political bondage but also equal distribution of wealth, abolition of caste barriers and social iniquities and destruction of communalism and religious intolerance.

HARM PRINCIPLE
Let us quote his
statement and then try to explain it.
The Issue of Dress Code If choosing what to wear is an expression of one’s freedom then how should we look at the following situations where there are restrictions on dress? o In China during Mao’s regime all the people had to wear ‘Mao suits’ based on the argument that it was an expression of equality. o A fatwa was issued against Sania Mirza for her style of dress that was considered, by one cleric, to be against the dress code prescribed for women. o The rules of a test match in cricket require every cricketer to wear white dress. o Students are required to wear school uniforms. Let us debate some questions. o Is the restriction on what to wear justified in all cases or only in some? When does it constitute a constraint on freedom? o Who has the authority to impose these constraints? Should religious leaders be given the authority to issue decrees on dress? Can the state decide what one should wear? Should the ICC set down rules of what to wear when playing cricket? o Is the imposition excessive? Does it diminish the many ways, people have of expressing themselves? o What are the consequences of accepting the impositions? Will the society become ‘equal’ if everyone dresses the same way as in Maoist China? Or are women being denied the participation in sports if they cannot wear clothes that would help them to compete effectively? Will the game be affected if cricketers wear coloured clothes? |

This is minor harm and should only provoke social disapproval. It
is not a fit case for legal punishment. Constraining actions by the
force of law should only happen when the other regarding actions
cause serious harm to definite individuals. Otherwise society must
bear the inconvenience in the spirit of protecting freedom.
Hate campaigns cause serious harm to the freedom
of others and actions that cause ‘serious harm’ are actions on
which constraints can be imposed. But we must make sure that
the constraints imposed are not so severe that they destroy freedom
itself. For example, we must not ask for life imprisonment for those
who only conduct hate campaign. Maybe some restriction on their
movement, or some curtailment of their right to hold public meetings
can be considered especially if they continue to carry on this
campaign in spite of warnings by the state to desist from conducting
such campaigns.
In the constitutional discussions in India, the term used for such
justifiable constraints is ‘reasonable restrictions’. The restrictions
may be there but they must be reasonable, i.e., capable of being
defended by reason, not excessive, not out of proportion to the action
being restricted, since then it would impinge on the general condition
of freedom in society. We must not develop a habit of imposing
restrictions since such a habit is detrimental to freedom.
2.5 NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE LIBERTY
Earlier in the chapter we had mentioned two dimensions of freedom
school— freedom as the absence of external constraints, and freedom
as the expansion of opportunities to express one’s self. In political
theory these have been called negative and positive liberty. ‘Negative
liberty’ seeks to define and defend an area in which the individual
would be inviolable, in which he or she could ‘do, be or become’
whatever he or she wished to ‘do, be or become’. This is an area in
which no external authority can interfere. It is a minimum area
that is sacred and in which whatever the individual does, is not to
The existence of the ‘minimum area of non-
interference’ is the recognition that human nature and human
dignity need an area where the person can act unobstructed by
others. How big should this area be, or what should it contain, are
matters of discussion, and will continue to be matters of debate
since the bigger the area of non-interference the more the freedom. All we need to recognise is that the negative liberty tradition
argues for an inviolable area of non-interference in which the
individual can express himself or herself. If the area is too small
then human dignity gets compromised. We may here ask the
obvious question: Is the choice of what clothes to wear in different
situations – school, playing-field, office – a choice that belongs to
the minimum area and therefore one that cannot be interfered with
by external authority or is it a choice that can be interfered with by
state, religious authority, ICC or CBSE. Negative liberty arguments
are in response to the question: ‘Over what area am I the master?’
It is concerned with explaining the idea of ‘freedom from’. The individual to develop his or her capability must
get the benefit of enabling positive conditions in material,
political and social domains. That is, the person must
not be constrained by poverty or unemployment; they
must have adequate material resources to pursue their
wants and needs. They must also have the opportunity
to participate in the decision making process so that
the laws made reflect their choices, or at least take those
preferences into account. Above all, to develop their mind
and intellect, individuals must have access to education
and other associated opportunities necessary to lead a
reasonably good life. Positive liberty recognises that one can be free only in society
(not outside it) and hence tries to make that society such that it
enables the development of the individual whereas negative liberty
is only concerned with the inviolable area of non-interference and
not with the conditions in society, outside this area, as such. Of
course negative liberty would like to expand this minimum area as
much as is possible keeping in mind, however, the stability of society. Generally they both go together and support each other, but it can
happen that tyrants justify their rule by invoking arguments of
positive liberty.
Freedom of Expression
One of the issues that is considered to belong to the minimum area
of ‘non-interference’ is the freedom of expression. J.S.Mill set out
good reasons why freedom of expression should not be restricted. This is a good case for discussion. At various times there have been demands to ban books, plays,
films, or academic articles in research journals. Let us think about
this demand to ban books in the light of our discussion so far which
sees freedom as ‘the making of choices’, where a distinction is made
between ‘negative and positive liberty’, where we recognise the need
for ‘justifiable constraints’ but these have to be supported by proper
procedures and important moral arguments. Freedom of expression
is a fundamental value and for that society must be willing to bear
some inconvenience to protect it from people who want to restrict
it. Remember Voltaire’s statement — ‘I disapprove of what you say
but I will defend to death your right to say it’. How deeply are we
committed to this freedom of expression? Some years ago Deepa Mehta, film maker, wanted to make a film
about widows in Varanasi. It sought to explore the plight of widows
but there was a strong protest from a section of the polity who felt
that it would show India in a very bad light, who felt it was being
made to cater to foreign audiences, who felt it would bring a bad
name to the ancient town. They refused to allow it to be made and as
a result it could not be made in Varanasi. It was subsequently made
elsewhere. Similarly the book Ramayana Retold by Aubrey Menon
and The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie were banned after protest
from some sections of society. The film The Last Temptation of Christ
and the play Me Nathuram Boltey were also banned after protests. Banning is an easy solution for the short term since it meets the
immediate demand but is very harmful for the long-term prospects
of freedom in a society because once one begins to ban then one
develops a habit of banning. But does this mean that we should
never ban? After all we do have censorship of films. John Stuart Mill, a political thinker and an activist in the nineteenth century Britain, offered a passionate defence of freedom of expression, including freedom |ust for interest, in England nyone who is employed to work or the Royal household is onstrained by contract (a onstraint?) from writing about the nner affairs of the household. So such a person were to leave the mployment they would be unable o give an interview or write an rticle or author a book about the olitics of the Royal household. Is his an unjustifiable constraint on he freedom of expression? Constraints of different kind hus exist and we are subject to hem in different situations. hile reflecting on such ituations we need to realise that hen constraints are backed by rganised social — religious or ultural — authority or by the ight of the state, they restrict ur freedom in ways that are ifficult to fight against. However, we willingly, or for the sake of ursuing our goals or ambitions, ccept certain restrictions, our eedom is not similarly limited. n any case if we are not coerced | of thought and discussion. In his book On Liberty he offered four reasons why there should be freedom of expression even for those who espouse ideas that appear ‘false’ or misleading today. First, no idea is completely false. What appears to us as false has an element of truth. If we ban ‘false’ ideas, we would lose that element of truth that they contain. This is related to the second point. Truth does not emerge by itself. It is only through a conflict of opposing views that truth emerges. Ideas that seem wrong today may have been very valuable in the emergence of what we consider right kind of ideas. Thirdly, this conflict of ideas is valuable not just in the past but is of continuing value for all times. Truth always runs the risk of being reduced to an unthinking cliché. It is only when we expose it to opposing views that we can be sure that this idea is trustworthy. Finally, we cannot be sure that what we consider true is actually true. Very often ideas that were considered false at one point by the entire society and, therefore, suppressed turned out to be true later on. A society that completely suppresses all ideas that are not acceptable today, runs the danger of losing the benefits of what might turn out to be into accepting the conditions, very valuable knowledge. We began by saying that freedom is the absence of external
constraints. We have now come to realise that freedom embodies
our capacity and our ability to make choices. And when we make
choices, we have also to accept responsibility for our actions and
their consequences. It is for this reason that most advocates of
liberty and freedom maintain that children must be placed in the
care of parents. Our capacity to make the right choices, to assess
in a reasoned manner available options, and shoulder the
responsibility of our actions, have to be built through education
and cultivation of judgement just as much as it needs to be nurtured
by limiting the authority of the state and the society.
Freedom
Human history provides many examples of people and communities which have been
dominated, or enslaved, or exploited, by more powerful groups. But it also provides us
with inspiring examples of heroic struggles against such domination. What is this freedom
for which people have been willing to sacrifice and die? In its essence, the struggle for
freedom represents the desire of people to be in control of their own lives and destinies
and to have the opportunity to express themselves freely through their choices and
activities. Not just individuals but societies also value their independence and wish to
protect their culture and future. However, given the diverse interests and ambitions of people any form of social
living requires some rules and regulation. These rules may require some constraints
to be imposed on the freedom of individuals but it is recognised that such constraints
may also free us from insecurity and provide us with the conditions in which we can
develop ourselves. In political theory much of the discussion regarding freedom has
therefore focused on trying to evolve principles by which we can distinguish between
socially necessary constraints and other restrictions. There has also been debate about
possible limitations on freedom which may result from the social and economic
structures of a society. In this chapter we will look at some of these debates. In this book he talks about his personal struggle
against the apartheid regime in South Africa, about the resistance
of his people to the segregationist policies of the white regiments
about the humiliations, hardships and police brutalities suffe
by the black people of South Africa. These ranged from being
bundled into townships and being denied easy movement about
the country, to being denied a free choice of whom to marry. Collectively, such measures constituted a body of constraints
imposed by the apartheid regime that discriminated between citizens
based on their race. For Mandela and his colleagues it was
struggle against such unjust constraints, the struggle to remember
the obstacles to the freedom of all the people of South Africa
just the black or the coloured but also the white people), that
the Long Walk to Freedom. For this freedom, Mandela spent twenty-seven
years of his life in jail, often in solitary
confinement. Imagine
what it meant to give up
one’s youth for an ideal,
to voluntarily give up the
pleasure of talking with
one’s friends, of playing
one’s favourite game
(Mandela loved boxing), of wearing one’s
favourite clothes, of listening to one’s
favourite music, of enjoying the many. 2.1 THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM
Aung San Suu Kyi saw her freedom as
onnected to the freedom of her people. Her book
essays bears the title Freedom from Fear. She says, “for me real
freedom is freedom from fear and unless you can live free from fear
you cannot live a dignified human life”. These are deep thoughts
that lead us to pause and consider their implications. We must not,
other words suggest, be afraid of the opinions of other people, or of the
attitude of authority, or of the reactions of the members of our
community to the things we want to do, of the ridicule of our peers,
or of speaking our mind. Yet we find that we often exhibit such fear. or Aung San Suu Kyi living a ‘dignified human life’ requires us to
be able to overcome such fear.
From these two books of Nelson Mandela and Aung
an Suu Kyi, we can see the power of the ideal of
freedom, an ideal that was at the centre of our national
struggle and the struggles of the peoples of Asia and
Africa against British, French and Portuguese
colonialism. Can you think of

A concept analogous to Freedom in Indian political thought is ‘Swaraj’. The term Swaraj incorporates within it two words — Swa (Self) and Raj
(Rule). It can be understood to mean both the rule of the self and rule over self. Swaraj, in the context of the freedom struggle in India referred to freedom as a constitutional and political demand, and as a value at the social-collective level. That is why Swaraj was such an important rallying cry in the freedom movement inspiring Tilak’s famous statement — “Swaraj is my birth right and I shall have it.” It is the understanding of Swaraj as Rule over the Self that was highlighted by Mahatma Gandhi in his work Hind Swaraj where he states, “It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves”. Swaraj is not just freedom but liberation in redeeming one’s self-respect, self-responsibility, and capacities for self-realisation from institutions of dehumanisation. Understanding the real ‘Self ’, and its relation to communities and society, is critical to the project of attaining Swaraj. Gandhiji believed the development that follows would liberate both individual and collective potentialities guided by the principle of justice.

Thus far we have defined freedom as the absence of constraint. To be free means to reduce or minimise social constraints that
limit our ability to make choices freely. However, this is only one
aspect of freedom. To put it in another way, freedom also has a
positive dimension. To be free a society must widen the area in
which individuals, groups, communities or nations,
will be able to charter their own destiny and be what
they wish to be. Freedom, in this sense, allows the full
development of the individual’s creativity, sensibilities
and capabilities: be it in sports, science, art, music or
exploration. A free society is one that enables one to
pursue one’s interests with a minimum of constraints. Freedom is considered valuable because it allows us
to make choices and to exercise our judgement. It
permits the exercise of the individual’s powers of
reason and judgement.
The Sources of Constraints
Restrictions on the freedom of individuals may come from
domination and external controls. Such restrictions may be imposed
by force or they may be imposed by a government through laws
which embody the power of the rulers over the people and which
may have the backing of force. This was the form of constraint
represented by colonial rulers over their subjects, or by the system
of apartheid in South Africa. Some form of government may be
inevitable but if the government is a democratic one, the members
of a state could retain some control over their rulers. That is why
democratic government is considered to be an important means of
protecting the freedom of people. But constraints on freedom can also result from social inequality
of the kind implicit in the caste system, or which result from extreme
economic inequality in a society. The quotation from Subhas
Chandra Bose on freedom draws attention to the need for the
country to work to remove such constraints. Girls and boys should
be free to decide whom
they wish to marry. Parents should have no
say in this matter.”

“If we are to bring about a revolution of ideas we have first to hold up before us an ideal which will galvanise our whole life. That ideal is freedom. But freedom is a word which has varied connotations and, even in our country, the conception of freedom has undergone a process of evolution. By freedom I mean all round freedom, i.e., freedom for the individual as well as for society; freedom for the rich as well as for the poor; freedom for men as well as for women; freedom for all individuals and for all classes. This freedom implies not only emancipation from political bondage but also equal distribution of wealth, abolition of caste barriers and social iniquities and destruction of communalism and religious intolerance. This is an ideal which may appear Utopian to hard-headed men and women, but this ideal alone can appease the hunger in the soul.” (Presidential Address to the Student’s Conference held at Lahore on )

But the creation of such a society too requires some constraints. At the very least, it requires that we be willing to respect differences
of views, opinions and beliefs. However, sometimes, we think that a strong commitment to our
beliefs requires that we must
oppose all those who differ
om or reject our views. We
see their views or ways of
believing as unacceptable. When we say that someone’s parents are very ‘liberal’, we usually mean that they are very tolerant.

In his book On Liberty he offered four reasons why there should be freedom of expression even for those who espouse ideas that appear ‘false’ or misleading today. First, no idea is completely false. What appears to us as false has an element of truth. If we ban ‘false’ ideas, we would lose that element of truth that they contain. This is related to the second point. Truth does not emerge by itself. It is only through a conflict of opposing views that truth emerges. Ideas that seem wrong today may have been very valuable in the emergence of what we consider right kind of ideas. Thirdly, this conflict of ideas is valuable not just in the past but is of continuing value for all times. Truth always runs the risk of being reduced to an unthinking cliché. It is only when we expose it to opposing views that we can be sure that this idea is trustworthy. Finally, we cannot be sure that what we consider true is actually true. Very often ideas that were considered false at one point by the entire society and, therefore, suppressed turned out to be true later on. A society that completely suppresses all ideas that are not acceptable today, runs the danger of losing the benefits of what might turn out to be into accepting the conditions, very valuable knowledge. We began by saying that freedom is the absence of external
constraints. We have now come to realise that freedom embodies
our capacity and our ability to make choices. And when we make
choices, we have also to accept responsibility for our actions and
their consequences. It is for this reason that most advocates of
liberty and freedom maintain that children must be placed in the
care of parents. Our capacity to make the right choices, to assess
in a reasoned manner available options, and shoulder the
responsibility of our actions, have to be built through education
and cultivation of judgement just as much as it needs to be nurtured
by limiting the authority of the state and the society.
Freedom
Human history provides many examples of people and communities which have been
dominated, or enslaved, or exploited, by more powerful groups. But it also provides us
with inspiring examples of heroic struggles against such domination. What is this freedom
for which people have been willing to sacrifice and die? In its essence, the struggle for
freedom represents the desire of people to be in control of their own lives and destinies
and to have the opportunity to express themselves freely through their choices and
activities. Not just individuals but societies also value their independence and wish to
protect their culture and future. However, given the diverse interests and ambitions of people any form of social
living requires some rules and regulation. These rules may require some constraints
to be imposed on the freedom of individuals but it is recognised that such constraints
may also free us from insecurity and provide us with the conditions in which we can
develop ourselves. In political theory much of the discussion regarding freedom has
therefore focused on trying to evolve principles by which we can distinguish between
socially necessary constraints and other restrictions. There has also been debate about
possible limitations on freedom which may result from the social and economic
structures of a society. In this chapter we will look at some of these debates. In this book he talks about his personal struggle
against the apartheid regime in South Africa, about the resistance
of his people to the segregationist policies of the white regiments
about the humiliations, hardships and police brutalities suffe
by the black people of South Africa. These ranged from being
bundled into townships and being denied easy movement about
the country, to being denied a free choice of whom to marry. Collectively, such measures constituted a body of constraints
imposed by the apartheid regime that discriminated between citizens
based on their race. For Mandela and his colleagues it was
struggle against such unjust constraints, the struggle to remember
the obstacles to the freedom of all the people of South Africa
just the black or the coloured but also the white people), that
the Long Walk to Freedom. For this freedom, Mandela spent twenty-seven
years of his life in jail, often in solitary
confinement. Imagine
what it meant to give up
one’s youth for an ideal,
to voluntarily give up the
pleasure of talking with
one’s friends, of playing
one’s favourite game
(Mandela loved boxing), of wearing one’s
favourite clothes, of listening to one’s
favourite music, of enjoying the many. 2.1 THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM
Aung San Suu Kyi saw her freedom as
onnected to the freedom of her people. Her book
essays bears the title Freedom from Fear. She says, “for me real
freedom is freedom from fear and unless you can live free from fear
you cannot live a dignified human life”. These are deep thoughts
that lead us to pause and consider their implications. We must not,
other words suggest, be afraid of the opinions of other people, or of the
attitude of authority, or of the reactions of the members of our
community to the things we want to do, of the ridicule of our peers,
or of speaking our mind. Yet we find that we often exhibit such fear. or Aung San Suu Kyi living a ‘dignified human life’ requires us to
be able to overcome such fear.
From these two books of Nelson Mandela and Aung
an Suu Kyi, we can see the power of the ideal of
freedom, an ideal that was at the centre of our national
struggle and the struggles of the peoples of Asia and
Africa against British, French and Portuguese
colonialism. Can you think of

A concept analogous to Freedom in Indian political thought is ‘Swaraj’. The term Swaraj incorporates within it two words — Swa (Self) and Raj
(Rule). It can be understood to mean both the rule of the self and rule over self. Swaraj, in the context of the freedom struggle in India referred to freedom as a constitutional and political demand, and as a value at the social-collective level. That is why Swaraj was such an important rallying cry in the freedom movement inspiring Tilak’s famous statement — “Swaraj is my birth right and I shall have it.” It is the understanding of Swaraj as Rule over the Self that was highlighted by Mahatma Gandhi in his work Hind Swaraj where he states, “It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves”. Swaraj is not just freedom but liberation in redeeming one’s self-respect, self-responsibility, and capacities for self-realisation from institutions of dehumanisation. Understanding the real ‘Self ’, and its relation to communities and society, is critical to the project of attaining Swaraj.

Thus far we have defined freedom as the absence of constraint. To be free means to reduce or minimise social constraints that
limit our ability to make choices freely. However, this is only one
aspect of freedom. To put it in another way, freedom also has a
positive dimension. To be free a society must widen the area in
which individuals, groups, communities or nations,
will be able to charter their own destiny and be what
they wish to be. Freedom, in this sense, allows the full
development of the individual’s creativity, sensibilities
and capabilities: be it in sports, science, art, music or
exploration. A free society is one that enables one to
pursue one’s interests with a minimum of constraints. Freedom is considered valuable because it allows us
to make choices and to exercise our judgement. It
permits the exercise of the individual’s powers of
reason and judgement.
The Sources of Constraints
Restrictions on the freedom of individuals may come from
domination and external controls. Such restrictions may be imposed
by force or they may be imposed by a government through laws
which embody the power of the rulers over the people and which
may have the backing of force. This was the form of constraint
represented by colonial rulers over their subjects, or by the system
of apartheid in South Africa. Some form of government may be
inevitable but if the government is a democratic one, the members
of a state could retain some control over their rulers. That is why
democratic government is considered to be an important means of
protecting the freedom of people. But constraints on freedom can also result from social inequality
of the kind implicit in the caste system, or which result from extreme
economic inequality in a society. The quotation from Subhas
Chandra Bose on freedom draws attention to the need for the
country to work to remove such constraints. Girls and boys should
be free to decide whom
they wish to marry. Parents should have no
say in this matter.”

“If we are to bring about a revolution of ideas we have first to hold up before us an ideal which will galvanise our whole life. That ideal is freedom. But freedom is a word which has varied connotations and, even in our country, the conception of freedom has undergone a process of evolution. By freedom I mean all round freedom, i.e., freedom for the individual as well as for society; freedom for the rich as well as for the poor; freedom for men as well as for women; freedom for all individuals and for all classes. This freedom implies not only emancipation from political bondage but also equal distribution of wealth, abolition of caste barriers and social iniquities and destruction of communalism and religious intolerance. This is an ideal which may appear Utopian to hard-headed men and women, but this ideal alone can appease the hunger in the soul.” (Presidential Address to the Student’s Conference held at Lahore on )

But the creation of such a society too requires some constraints. At the very least, it requires that we be willing to respect differences
of views, opinions and beliefs. However, sometimes, we think that a strong commitment to our
beliefs requires that we must
oppose all those who differ
om or reject our views. We
see their views or ways of
believing as unacceptable. When we say that someone’s parents are very ‘liberal’, we usually mean that they are very tolerant.

HARM PRINCIPLE
Let us quote his
statement and then try to explain it.
The Issue of Dress Code If choosing what to wear is an expression of one’s freedom then how should we look at the following situations where there are restrictions on dress? o In China during Mao’s regime all the people had to wear ‘Mao suits’ based on the argument that it was an expression of equality. o A fatwa was issued against Sania Mirza for her style of dress that was considered, by one cleric, to be against the dress code prescribed for women. o The rules of a test match in cricket require every cricketer to wear white dress. o Students are required to wear school uniforms. Let us debate some questions. o Is the restriction on what to wear justified in all cases or only in some? When does it constitute a constraint on freedom? o Who has the authority to impose these constraints? Should religious leaders be given the authority to issue decrees on dress? Can the state decide what one should wear? Should the ICC set down rules of what to wear when playing cricket? o Is the imposition excessive? Does it diminish the many ways, people have of expressing themselves? o What are the consequences of accepting the impositions? Will the society become ‘equal’ if everyone dresses the same way as in Maoist China? Or are women being denied the participation in sports if they cannot wear clothes that would help them to compete effectively? Will the game be affected if cricketers wear coloured clothes? |

This is minor harm and should only provoke social disapproval. It
is not a fit case for legal punishment. Constraining actions by the
force of law should only happen when the other regarding actions
cause serious harm to definite individuals. Otherwise society must
bear the inconvenience in the spirit of protecting freedom.
Hate campaigns cause serious harm to the freedom
of others and actions that cause ‘serious harm’ are actions on
which constraints can be imposed. But we must make sure that
the constraints imposed are not so severe that they destroy freedom
itself. For example, we must not ask for life imprisonment for those
who only conduct hate campaign. Maybe some restriction on their
movement, or some curtailment of their right to hold public meetings
can be considered especially if they continue to carry on this
campaign in spite of warnings by the state to desist from conducting
such campaigns.
In the constitutional discussions in India, the term used for such
justifiable constraints is ‘reasonable restrictions’. The restrictions
may be there but they must be reasonable, i.e., capable of being
defended by reason, not excessive, not out of proportion to the action
being restricted, since then it would impinge on the general condition
of freedom in society. We must not develop a habit of imposing
restrictions since such a habit is detrimental to freedom.
2.5 NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE LIBERTY
Earlier in the chapter we had mentioned two dimensions of freedom
school— freedom as the absence of external constraints, and freedom
as the expansion of opportunities to express one’s self. In political
theory these have been called negative and positive liberty. ‘Negative
liberty’ seeks to define and defend an area in which the individual
would be inviolable, in which he or she could ‘do, be or become’
whatever he or she wished to ‘do, be or become’. This is an area in
which no external authority can interfere. It is a minimum area
that is sacred and in which whatever the individual does, is not to
The existence of the ‘minimum area of non-
interference’ is the recognition that human nature and human
dignity need an area where the person can act unobstructed by
others. How big should this area be, or what should it contain, are
matters of discussion, and will continue to be matters of debate
since the bigger the area of non-interference the more the freedom. All we need to recognise is that the negative liberty tradition
argues for an inviolable area of non-interference in which the
individual can express himself or herself. If the area is too small
then human dignity gets compromised. We may here ask the
obvious question: Is the choice of what clothes to wear in different
situations – school, playing-field, office – a choice that belongs to
the minimum area and therefore one that cannot be interfered with
by external authority or is it a choice that can be interfered with by
state, religious authority, ICC or CBSE. Negative liberty arguments
are in response to the question: ‘Over what area am I the master?’
It is concerned with explaining the idea of ‘freedom from’. The individual to develop his or her capability must
get the benefit of enabling positive conditions in material,
political and social domains. That is, the person must
not be constrained by poverty or unemployment; they
must have adequate material resources to pursue their
wants and needs. They must also have the opportunity
to participate in the decision making process so that
the laws made reflect their choices, or at least take those
preferences into account. Above all, to develop their mind
and intellect, individuals must have access to education
and other associated opportunities necessary to lead a
reasonably good life. Positive liberty recognises that one can be free only in society
(not outside it) and hence tries to make that society such that it
enables the development of the individual whereas negative liberty
is only concerned with the inviolable area of non-interference and
not with the conditions in society, outside this area, as such. Of
course negative liberty would like to expand this minimum area as
much as is possible keeping in mind, however, the stability of society. Generally they both go together and support each other, but it can
happen that tyrants justify their rule by invoking arguments of
positive liberty.
Freedom of Expression
One of the issues that is considered to belong to the minimum area
of ‘non-interference’ is the freedom of expression. J.S.Mill set out
good reasons why freedom of expression should not be restricted. This is a good case for discussion. At various times there have been demands to ban books, plays,
films, or academic articles in research journals. Let us think about
this demand to ban books in the light of our discussion so far which
sees freedom as ‘the making of choices’, where a distinction is made
between ‘negative and positive liberty’, where we recognise the need
for ‘justifiable constraints’ but these have to be supported by proper
procedures and important moral arguments. Freedom of expression
is a fundamental value and for that society must be willing to bear
some inconvenience to protect it from people who want to restrict
it. Remember Voltaire’s statement — ‘I disapprove of what you say
but I will defend to death your right to say it’. How deeply are we
committed to this freedom of expression? Some years ago Deepa Mehta, film maker, wanted to make a film
about widows in Varanasi. It sought to explore the plight of widows
but there was a strong protest from a section of the polity who felt
that it would show India in a very bad light, who felt it was being
made to cater to foreign audiences, who felt it would bring a bad
name to the ancient town. They refused to allow it to be made and as
a result it could not be made in Varanasi. It was subsequently made
elsewhere. Similarly the book Ramayana Retold by Aubrey Menon
and The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie were banned after protest
from some sections of society. The film The Last Temptation of Christ
and the play Me Nathuram Boltey were also banned after protests. Banning is an easy solution for the short term since it meets the
immediate demand but is very harmful for the long-term prospects
of freedom in a society because once one begins to ban then one
develops a habit of banning. But does this mean that we should
never ban? After all we do have censorship of films. John Stuart Mill, a political thinker and an activist in the nineteenth century Britain, offered a passionate defence of freedom of expression, including freedom |ust for interest, in England nyone who is employed to work or the Royal household is onstrained by contract (a onstraint?) from writing about the nner affairs of the household.
