6.Main Characteristics of Constitution of India. The Constitution of India has some distinct and unique features as compared to other constitutions to the world. Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee puts it, the framers had tried to accumulate and accommodate the best features of other constitutions, keeping in view the peculiar problems and needs of our country. Main Characteristics of Constitution of India are:- Longest written constitution. Partly Rigid and Partly Flexible A Democratic Republic Parliamentary System of Government A Federation Fundamental Rights Directive Principles of State Policy
Fundamental Duties Secular State An Independent Judiciary Single Citizenship A Constitution symbolizes independence of a country. Framework and structure for the governance of a free country are provided in the Constitution.

The framing of the Constitution was completed on when the Constituent Assembly formally adopted the new Constitution. The Constitution came into force with effect from . The Constitution begins with a Preamble which declares India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic.

The Constitution of India has several distinctive features. It is the lengthiest Constitution in the world and it is a combination of rigidity and flexibility. The Constitution provides for a quasi-federal (It means a federal set up where despite having two clear sets of government – central and the states, more powers are given to the Central Government.) set up with a strong centre. There is a clear division of powers between the Centre and the States. The Supreme Court of India, is the apex court of India which will resolve the disputes between the centre and state or between the states. India has a parliamentary democracy. The Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister enjoys the real powers and is responsible to the Parliament. The Indian Constitution provides for Fundamental Rights which are justifiable. Ten Fundamental Duties have also been added to the Constitution. The Directive Principles of State Policy give a concrete shape to the welfare concept. It is time to undertake a study of Indian Federalism with a view to valuate the trends, frictions and difficulties which have developed in the area of inter-governmental relations and to seek to evolve ways and means to meet the challenging task of making the Indian federation a more robust, strong and workable system so that the country may meet the tasks of self-improvement and development. The responsibility lies on not only the jurists and policy framers, but also the citizens of the country to work in a harmonious manner for the development of the country.
